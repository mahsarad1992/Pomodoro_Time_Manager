# Pomodoro_Time_Manager
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
The technique has been widely popularized by apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

The original technique has six steps:
1-Decide on the task to be done.
2-Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3-Work on the task.
4-End work when the timer is on 00:00 and take a short break (typically for 5 minutes).
5-If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6-After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is an interval of work time.
Regular breaks are taken, aiding assimilation. A 5-minute break separates consecutive pomodoros. Four pomodoros form a set. There is a longer 20 minute break between sets.

A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.
